This kind of failure is very common on older bikes, and the symptoms you describe are actually quite diagnostic 👍

From what you’re seeing:
	•	The brake lever barely moves
	•	Brake pads do not move at all
	•	Even squeezing very hard gives only a couple mm of lever travel

That almost always means the problem is at the lever / cable interface, not the brake pads themselves.

Below is a structured way to get the brakes working again.

⸻

Most likely causes (in order of likelihood)

1. Brake cable is seized inside the housing

On old bikes, the steel inner cable often rusts solid inside the housing.

Signs
	•	Lever feels rock-hard
	•	Lever barely moves
	•	No pad movement at all

Fix
	•	Disconnect the brake cable at the brake caliper
	•	Try pulling the bare cable by hand:
	•	If it doesn’t slide freely, the cable + housing must be replaced
	•	Replace both:
	•	Inner brake cable
	•	Outer housing
(They’re cheap and replacement is usually the correct solution)

⚠️ Lubricating a badly rusted cable is rarely reliable or safe.

2. Lever pivot or cam mechanism is seized

Old brake levers often use an internal cam or pivot that can seize with corrosion.

Signs
	•	Cable is free when disconnected
	•	Lever still barely moves
	•	Lever feels like it’s hitting a hard stop immediately

Fix
	1.	Remove the lever from the handlebar
	2.	Inspect pivot / cam area
	3.	Flood with penetrating oil (PB Blaster, Kroil, etc.)
	4.	Work the lever back and forth
	5.	If it doesn’t free up:
	•	Replace the lever (often easier and safer)

🚲 Vintage levers are plentiful and inexpensive.

3. Cable head incorrectly seated in the lever

Sometimes the cable nipple slips out of its pocket or jams at an angle.

Signs
	•	Lever travel is extremely short
	•	Cable looks “bunched” at the lever

Fix
	•	Open the lever fully
	•	Reseat the cable head properly
	•	Ensure the cable runs smoothly into the housing

⸻

4. Brake caliper itself is seized (less likely given your symptoms)

If the pads and caliper arms are frozen, you’d usually still see lever movement.

Fix
	•	Disconnect cable
	•	Try moving brake arms by hand
	•	Clean pivots, lubricate, or rebuild

⸻

What I would do (practical step-by-step)
	1.	Disconnect the brake cable at the brake
	2.	Pull the cable by hand:
	•	❌ Stuck → replace cable + housing
	•	✅ Slides freely → lever is the issue
	3.	If cable is free:
	•	Remove lever
	•	Try cleaning + lubricating pivot
	•	If still stiff → replace lever
	4.	Reassemble and adjust brake pads and cable tension

⸻

Strong recommendation (safety)

Because this is a brake, the safest and fastest solution on an old bike is usually:

New brake cable + new housing + inspect/replace lever if stiff

This will dramatically improve braking feel and reliability.

If you want, you can:
	•	Tell me what type of brakes these are (caliper, cantilever, rod brake, etc.)
	•	Or share a photo of the actual brake caliper

and I can give you exact adjustment steps once everything is moving again.
